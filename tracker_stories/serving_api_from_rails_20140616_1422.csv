You need to handle both XML and JSON from all of the /makes API endpoints.

The structure of the XML will be slightly different than the JSON. As an example, the /makes/:id XML will look like this:

<apiResponse>
 	<links>
 		<self href=""/makes/1"">
 	</links>
 	<make>
 		<id>2</id>
 		<name>Ford</name>
 	</make>
</apiResponse>

The /makes response will look like this:

<apiResponse>
 	<links>
 		<self href=""/makes"">
 	</links>
 	<makes>
	 	<make>
	 		<links>
		 		<self href=""/makes/1"">
